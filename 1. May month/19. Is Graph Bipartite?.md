# Is Graph Bipartite?

<h3>
There is an undirected graph with n nodes, where each node is numbered between 0 and n - 1. You are given a 2D array graph, where graph[u] is an array of nodes that node u is adjacent to. More formally, for each v in graph[u], there is an undirected edge between node u and node v. The graph has the following properties:

  * There are no self-edges (graph[u] does not contain u).
  
  * There are no parallel edges (graph[u] does not contain duplicate values).
  
  * If v is in graph[u], then u is in graph[v] (the graph is undirected).
  
  * The graph may not be connected, meaning there may be two nodes u and v such that there is no path between them.
  
A graph is bipartite if the nodes can be partitioned into two independent sets A and B such that every edge in the graph connects a node in set A and a node in set B.

Return true if and only if it is bipartite.

**Solution :-**

```
class Solution {
	public:
		bool check(int start,vector<vector<int>>& adj,vector<int>& color){
			queue<int>q;
			color[start]=0;
			q.push(start);
			while(!q.empty()){
				int prev=q.front();
				q.pop();
				for(auto curr: adj[prev]){
					if(color[curr]==-1){
						color[curr]=!color[prev];
						q.push(curr);
					}
					else if(color[curr]==color[prev]) return false;
				}
			}
			return true;
		}

		bool isBipartite(vector<vector<int>>& adj) {
			int n=adj.size();
			vector<int> color(n,-1);
			for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
				if(color[i]==-1 && !check(i,adj,color)) return false; 
			}
			return true;
		}
	};
