# Stone Game II

<h3>
Alice and Bob continue their games with piles of stones.  There are a number of piles arranged in a row, and each pile has a positive integer number of stones piles[i].  The objective of the game is to end with the most stones. 

Alice and Bob take turns, with Alice starting first.  Initially, M = 1.

On each player's turn, that player can take all the stones in the first X remaining piles, where 1 <= X <= 2M.  Then, we set M = max(M, X).

The game continues until all the stones have been taken.

Assuming Alice and Bob play optimally, return the maximum number of stones Alice can get.

**Solution :-**

```
class Solution {
public:

    int dp[101][201];

    int helper(int i,int m,vector<int>& piles){

         if(i >= piles.size())
         return 0;

         if(dp[i][m] != -1)
         return dp[i][m];

         int total = 0;
         int ans = INT_MIN;

         for(int j=0;j<2*m;j++){

             if(i+j < piles.size())
              total += piles[i+j];

              ans = max(ans,total - helper(i+j+1,max(m,j+1),piles));  
         }

        return dp[i][m] = ans;
    }
    
    int stoneGameII(vector<int>& piles) {
        memset(dp,-1,sizeof dp);
        int sum = 0;
        for(auto x:piles)
         sum += x;
         
         int diff = helper(0,1,piles);
        
        return (sum+diff)/2;
    }
};
