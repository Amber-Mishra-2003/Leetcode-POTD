# Count Ways To Build Good Strings

<h3>
Given the integers zero, one, low, and high, we can construct a string by starting with an empty string, and then at each step perform either of the following:

Append the character '0' zero times.
Append the character '1' one times.
This can be performed any number of times.

A good string is a string constructed by the above process having a length between low and high (inclusive).

Return the number of different good strings that can be constructed satisfying these properties. Since the answer can be large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

**Solution :-**

```
class Solution {
    #define ll long long
public:
    ll mod=1e9+7;
    int countGoodStrings(int low, int high, int zero, int one) {
        vector<ll>dp(high+1,0);
        dp[0]=1;
        ll ans=0;
        for(int i=1;i<=high;i++){
            if(i>=zero){
                dp[i] = (dp[i]%mod + dp[abs(zero-i)]%mod)%mod; 
            }
            if(i>=one){
                dp[i] = (dp[i]%mod + dp[abs(one-i)]%mod)%mod; 
            }
            if(i>=low){
                ans = (ans%mod + dp[i]%mod)%mod;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```
