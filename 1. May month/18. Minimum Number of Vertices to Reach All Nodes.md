# Minimum Number of Vertices to Reach All Nodes

<h3>
Given a directed acyclic graph, with n vertices numbered from 0 to n-1, and an array edges where edges[i] = [fromi, toi] represents a directed edge from node fromi to node toi.

Find the smallest set of vertices from which all nodes in the graph are reachable. It's guaranteed that a unique solution exists.

Notice that you can return the vertices in any order.

**Solution :-**

```
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> findSmallestSetOfVertices(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
        
         vector<int> res, visited(n);

        for (auto& e: edges)
            visited[e[1]] = 1;

        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            if (visited[i] == 0)
                res.push_back(i);
                
        return res;
    }
};
```
