# Design Parking System

<h3>
Design a parking system for a parking lot. The parking lot has three kinds of parking spaces: big, medium, and small, with a fixed number of slots for each size.

Implement the ParkingSystem class:

  * ParkingSystem(int big, int medium, int small) Initializes object of the ParkingSystem class. The number of slots for each parking space are given as part of the constructor.
  
  * bool addCar(int carType) Checks whether there is a parking space of carType for the car that wants to get into the parking lot. carType can be of three kinds: big, medium, or small, which are represented by 1, 2, and 3 respectively. A car can only park in a parking space of its carType. If there is no space available, return false, else park the car in that size space and return true.

**Soltuion :-**

```
class ParkingSystem {
public:
    vector<pair<int,int>> op;
    ParkingSystem(int big, int medium, int small) {
        op.push_back({big,1});
        op.push_back({medium,2});
        op.push_back({small,3});
    }
    
    bool addCar(int carType) {

        for(int i=0;i<op.size();i++)
        {
            if(op[i].second==carType and op[i].first>0)
            {
                op[i].first-=1;
                return 1;
            }
        }
        return 0;
        
    }
};

/**
 * Your ParkingSystem object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * ParkingSystem* obj = new ParkingSystem(big, medium, small);
 * bool param_1 = obj->addCar(carType);
 */
