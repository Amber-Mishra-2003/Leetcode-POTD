The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node.

Note: A leaf is a node with no children.

**Solution :-**

```
class Solution {
public:
    int minDepth(TreeNode* root) {
        if(!root)
            return 0;
        if(!root->left)
            return 1 + minDepth(root->right);
        if(!root->right)
            return 1 + minDepth(root->left);
        return 1 + min(minDepth(root->right), minDepth(root->left));       
    }
};
```
