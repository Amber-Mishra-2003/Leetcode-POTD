# Number of Provinces

<h3>
There are n cities. Some of them are connected, while some are not. If city a is connected directly with city b, and city b is connected directly with city c, then city a is connected indirectly with city c.

A province is a group of directly or indirectly connected cities and no other cities outside of the group.

You are given an n x n matrix isConnected where isConnected[i][j] = 1 if the ith city and the jth city are directly connected, and isConnected[i][j] = 0 otherwise.

Return the total number of provinces.

**Solution :-**

```
class Solution {
    int res;
    int c = 0;
    int n;
    int vis[201]={0};



    void dfs(vector<vector<int>>& isConnected,int start)
    {
        vis[start] = true;
        c++;
        for(int connection = 0;connection<n;connection++)
        {
            if(!vis[connection] and isConnected[start][connection]) 
            {
            dfs(isConnected,connection);
            }
        }
    }
public:
    int findCircleNum(vector<vector<int>>& isConnected) {
        n = isConnected.size();
        for(int i = 0;i<n;i++) 
        {
            if(!vis[i]) 
            {
                c=0;
                dfs(isConnected,i);
                res++;
            }
        }
        return res;   
    }
