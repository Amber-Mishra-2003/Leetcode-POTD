# K Radius Subarray Averages

<h3>
You are given a 0-indexed array nums of n integers, and an integer k.

The k-radius average for a subarray of nums centered at some index i with the radius k is the average of all elements in nums between the indices i - k and i + k (inclusive). If there are less than k elements before or after the index i, then the k-radius average is -1.

Build and return an array avgs of length n where avgs[i] is the k-radius average for the subarray centered at index i.

The average of x elements is the sum of the x elements divided by x, using integer division. The integer division truncates toward zero, which means losing its fractional part.

  * For example, the average of four elements 2, 3, 1, and 5 is (2 + 3 + 1 + 5) / 4 = 11 / 4 = 2.75, which truncates to 2.

**Solution :-**

```
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> getAverages(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
     int j=0,temp=2*k;
        long int  sum=0;
        vector<int>v (nums.size(),-1);

         for(int i=0; i<nums.size(); i++)
          {
            sum+=nums[i];
            if(i>=temp)
            {
            v[k++]=sum/(temp+1);
            sum-=nums[j++];
            }
          }
         return  v;     
    }
};
