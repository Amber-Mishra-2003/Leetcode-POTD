# Total Cost to Hire K Workers

<h3>
ou are given a 0-indexed integer array costs where costs[i] is the cost of hiring the ith worker.

You are also given two integers k and candidates. We want to hire exactly k workers according to the following rules:

  * You will run k sessions and hire exactly one worker in each session.

  * In each hiring session, choose the worker with the lowest cost from either the first candidates workers or the last candidates workers. Break the tie by the smallest index.
    
  * For example, if costs = [3,2,7,7,1,2] and candidates = 2, then in the first hiring session, we will choose the 4th worker because they have the lowest cost [3,2,7,7,1,2].
    
  * In the second hiring session, we will choose 1st worker because they have the same lowest cost as 4th worker but they have the smallest index [3,2,7,7,2]. Please note that the indexing may be changed in the process.
    
  * If there are fewer than candidates workers remaining, choose the worker with the lowest cost among them. Break the tie by the smallest index.
    
  * A worker can only be chosen once.
    
Return the total cost to hire exactly k workers.

**Solution :-**

```
class Solution {
public:
    long long totalCost(vector<int>& costs, int k, int candidates) {

        long long ans=0;
        priority_queue<int,vector<int>,greater<int>> pq1,pq2;

        int cnt = 0;
        int i=0;
        int j=costs.size()-1;

        while(cnt<k){

            while(pq1.size()<candidates && i<=j) pq1.push(costs[i++]);
            while(pq2.size()<candidates && j>=i) pq2.push(costs[j--]);

            int cost1 = pq1.size()>0?pq1.top():INT_MAX;
            int cost2 = pq2.size()>0?pq2.top():INT_MAX;

            if(cost1<=cost2){

               ans += cost1;
               pq1.pop();
            }
            else{

              ans += cost2;
              pq2.pop();
            }

            cnt++;
        }

        return ans;
    }
};
