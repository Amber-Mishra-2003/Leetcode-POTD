# Minimum Flips to Make a OR b Equal to c

<h3>
Given 3 positives numbers a, b and c. Return the minimum flips required in some bits of a and b to make ( a OR b == c ). (bitwise OR operation).
Flip operation consists of change any single bit 1 to 0 or change the bit 0 to 1 in their binary representation.

**Solution :-**

```
class Solution {
public:
    int minFlips(int a, int b, int c) {
        int ans=0;
        while(a||b||c){
            int x1=a&1;
            int x2=b&1;
            int x3=c&1;
            if((x1|x2)!=x3){
                if(x1&x2)   ans+=2;
                else ans+=1;
            }
            a=a>>1;
            b=b>>1;
            c=c>>1;
        }
