#  Minimum Number of Taps to Open to Water a Garden

<h3>
There is a one-dimensional garden on the x-axis. The garden starts at the point 0 and ends at the point n. (i.e The length of the garden is n).

There are n + 1 taps located at points [0, 1, ..., n] in the garden.

Given an integer n and an integer array ranges of length n + 1 where ranges[i] (0-indexed) means the i-th tap can water the area [i - ranges[i], i + ranges[i]] if it was open.

Return the minimum number of taps that should be open to water the whole garden, If the garden cannot be watered return -1.

**Solution :-**

```
class Solution {
public:
    int minTaps(int n, vector<int>& ranges) {
         vector<int> arr(n + 1, 0);
        for(int i = 0; i < ranges.size(); ++i) {
            if(ranges[i] == 0) continue;
            int left = max(0, i - ranges[i]);
            arr[left] = max(arr[left], i + ranges[i]);
        }
        
        int end = 0, far_can_reach = 0, cnt = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i <= n; ++i) {
            if(i > end) {
                if(far_can_reach <= end) return -1;
                end = far_can_reach;
                ++cnt;
            }
            far_can_reach = max(far_can_reach, arr[i]);
        }
        
        return cnt + (end < n);
    }
};
```
