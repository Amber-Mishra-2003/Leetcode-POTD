# Minimum Penalty for a Shop

<h3>
You are given the customer visit log of a shop represented by a 0-indexed string customers consisting only of characters 'N' and 'Y':

  * if the ith character is 'Y', it means that customers come at the ith hour
    
  * whereas 'N' indicates that no customers come at the ith hour.
    
If the shop closes at the jth hour (0 <= j <= n), the penalty is calculated as follows:

  * For every hour when the shop is open and no customers come, the penalty increases by 1.
    
  * For every hour when the shop is closed and customers come, the penalty increases by 1.
    
Return the earliest hour at which the shop must be closed to incur a minimum penalty.

Note that if a shop closes at the jth hour, it means the shop is closed at the hour j.

**Solution :-**

```
class Solution {
public:
    int bestClosingTime(string customers) {
        int max_score = 0, score = 0, best_hour = -1;
        for(int i = 0; i < customers.size(); ++i) {
            score += (customers[i] == 'Y') ? 1 : -1;
            if(score > max_score) {
                max_score = score;
                best_hour = i;
            }
        }
        return best_hour + 1;
    }
};
