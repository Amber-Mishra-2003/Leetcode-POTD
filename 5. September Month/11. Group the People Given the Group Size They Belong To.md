#  Group the People Given the Group Size They Belong To

<h3>
There are n people that are split into some unknown number of groups. Each person is labeled with a unique ID from 0 to n - 1.

You are given an integer array groupSizes, where groupSizes[i] is the size of the group that person i is in. For example, if groupSizes[1] = 3, then person 1 must be in a group of size 3.

Return a list of groups such that each person i is in a group of size groupSizes[i].

Each person should appear in exactly one group, and every person must be in a group. If there are multiple answers, return any of them. It is guaranteed that there will be at least one valid solution for the given input.

**Solution :-**

```
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> groupThePeople(vector<int>& groupSizes) {
        int n = groupSizes.size();
        map<int,vector<int>> mp;
        vector<vector<int>> l;
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
        {
            mp[groupSizes[i]].push_back(i);

            if(mp[groupSizes[i]].size()==groupSizes[i])
            {
                l.push_back(mp[groupSizes[i]]);
                mp[groupSizes[i]] = {};
            }
        }
        return l;
    }
};
