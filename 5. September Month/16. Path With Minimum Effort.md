# Path With Minimum Effort

<h3>
You are a hiker preparing for an upcoming hike. You are given heights, a 2D array of size rows x columns, where heights[row][col] represents the height of cell (row, col). You are situated in the top-left cell, (0, 0), and you hope to travel to the bottom-right cell, (rows-1, columns-1) (i.e., 0-indexed). You can move up, down, left, or right, and you wish to find a route that requires the minimum effort.

A route's effort is the maximum absolute difference in heights between two consecutive cells of the route.

Return the minimum effort required to travel from the top-left cell to the bottom-right cell.

**Solution :-**

```
class Solution {
public:
    int minimumEffortPath(vector<vector<int>>& heights) {
        int rows = heights.size(), cols = heights[0].size();
        vector<vector<int>> dist(rows, vector<int>(cols, INT_MAX));
        priority_queue<tuple<int, int, int>, vector<tuple<int, int, int>>, greater<>> minHeap;
        minHeap.emplace(0, 0, 0);
        dist[0][0] = 0;
        
        int directions[4][2] = {{0, 1}, {0, -1}, {1, 0}, {-1, 0}};
        
        while (!minHeap.empty()) {
            auto [effort, x, y] = minHeap.top();
            minHeap.pop();
            
            if (effort > dist[x][y]) continue;
            
            if (x == rows - 1 && y == cols - 1) return effort;
            
            for (auto& dir : directions) {
                int nx = x + dir[0], ny = y + dir[1];
                if (nx >= 0 && nx < rows && ny >= 0 && ny < cols) {
                    int new_effort = max(effort, abs(heights[x][y] - heights[nx][ny]));
                    if (new_effort < dist[nx][ny]) {
                        dist[nx][ny] = new_effort;
                        minHeap.emplace(new_effort, nx, ny);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
};
