# The K Weakest Rows in a Matrix

<h3>
You are given an m x n binary matrix mat of 1's (representing soldiers) and 0's (representing civilians). The soldiers are positioned in front of the civilians. That is, all the 1's will appear to the left of all the 0's in each row.

A row i is weaker than a row j if one of the following is true:

  * The number of soldiers in row i is less than the number of soldiers in row j.
    
  * Both rows have the same number of soldiers and i < j.
    
Return the indices of the k weakest rows in the matrix ordered from weakest to strongest.

**Solution :-**

```
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> kWeakestRows(vector<vector<int>>& matrix, int k) {
        // Using a vector to store pairs of the sum of soldiers and their respective row indices
        vector<pair<int, int>> soldiers;

        // Calculate the sum of soldiers for each row and store in the min heap
        for(int row = 0; row < matrix.size(); row++) {
            int soldierCount = findSoldierCount(matrix[row]);
            soldiers.push_back({soldierCount, row}) ;
        }

        // Sort then get the k weakest rows
        sort(soldiers.begin(), soldiers.end());
        vector<int> weakestRows;
        for(int i = 0 ; i < k ; i ++){
            weakestRows.push_back(soldiers[i].second);
        }
        return weakestRows;
    }

    int findSoldierCount(vector<int> &row) {
        int left = 0, right = row.size() - 1;

        // Perform binary search to find the count of soldiers
        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = (left + right) / 2;
            if (row[mid] == 1)
                left = mid + 1;
            else
                right = mid - 1;
        }

        return left;
    }
};
