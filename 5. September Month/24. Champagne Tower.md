# Champagne Tower

<h3>
We stack glasses in a pyramid, where the first row has 1 glass, the second row has 2 glasses, and so on until the 100th row.  Each glass holds one cup of champagne.

Then, some champagne is poured into the first glass at the top.  When the topmost glass is full, any excess liquid poured will fall equally to the glass immediately to the left and right of it.  When those glasses become full, any excess champagne will fall equally to the left and right of those glasses, and so on.  (A glass at the bottom row has its excess champagne fall on the floor.)

For example, after one cup of champagne is poured, the top most glass is full.  After two cups of champagne are poured, the two glasses on the second row are half full.  After three cups of champagne are poured, those two cups become full - there are 3 full glasses total now.  After four cups of champagne are poured, the third row has the middle glass half full, and the two outside glasses are a quarter full, as pictured below.

**Solution :-**

```
class Solution {
public:
    double t[101][101]; // declaring 2 d array, to store some already computed results
    double solve(int poured, int row, int glass)
    {
        // if any of the condition fails
        if(row < 0 || glass > row || glass < 0)
        {
            return 0.00;
        }
        
        // if we reach at our target 
        if(row == 0 && glass == 0)
        {
            return poured;
        }
        
        // if result is already computed, then return from here
        // this one line which we say to add
        if(t[row][glass] > -1)
        {
            return t[row][glass];
        }
        
        // how much comes from left part- first coordinate(i -1, j - 1) then keep 1 for themself and then divide by 2
        double left = (solve(poured, row - 1, glass - 1) - 1) / 2;
        
        // if comes negative then, in reality zero comes
        if(left < 0)
        {
            left = 0;
        }
        
        // how much comes from right part- first coordinate(i - 1, j) then keep 1 for themself and then divide by 2
        double right = (solve(poured, row - 1, glass) - 1) / 2;
        
        // if comes negative then, in reality zero comes
        if(right < 0)
        {
            right = 0;
        }
        
        // and add coming from left and right
        double total = left + right;
        
        return t[row][glass] = total;// and finally return total
        
        
    }
    double champagneTower(int poured, int query_row, int query_glass) {
         memset(t, -1, sizeof(t));
        
        // solve funcion which return answer
        return min(1.00, solve(poured, query_row, query_glass));
    }
};
