# Longest String Chain

<h3>
You are given an array of words where each word consists of lowercase English letters.

wordA is a predecessor of wordB if and only if we can insert exactly one letter anywhere in wordA without changing the order of the other characters to make it equal to wordB.

  * For example, "abc" is a predecessor of "abac", while "cba" is not a predecessor of "bcad".
    
A word chain is a sequence of words [word1, word2, ..., wordk] with k >= 1, where word1 is a predecessor of word2, word2 is a predecessor of word3, and so on. A single word is trivially a word chain with k == 1.


Return the length of the longest possible word chain with words chosen from the given list of words.

**Solution :-**

```
class Solution {
public:
        static bool cmp(const string &s1, const string &s2) {
        return s1.length() < s2.length();
    }

    int longestStrChain(vector<string>& words) {
        sort(words.begin(), words.end(), cmp);
        unordered_map<string, int> ump;
        int ans = 0;
        for (string w : words) {
            int longest=0;
            for (int i = 0; i < w.length(); i++) {
                string sub = w;
                sub.erase(i, 1);
                longest = max(longest,ump[sub]+1);
            }
            ump[w] = longest;
            ans = max(ans,longest);
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
