# Is Subsequence

<h3>
Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.

A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).

**Solution :-**

```
class Solution {
public:
    bool isSubsequence(string s, string t) {
        int j=0;
        int y=s.size();
        for(int i=0;i<t.size();i++)
        {
            if(s[j]==t[i])
            {
                j++;
            }
            if(j==y)
            {
                return true;
            }
        }
        if(j==y)
            return true;
        else
            return false;
